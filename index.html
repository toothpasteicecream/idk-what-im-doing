       <h2>why i wanted to learn how to code</h2>
         <p>ok idk why i had a random surge to want to learn how to code but after thinking about it i think i know why now --
            i always liked the idea of coding bc i was surrounded by so many coding/cs/programming ppl in middle school (most notably tiffany, caden, max).
            + also when i was peak discord mod in south (h)ub ((school discord server btw)) i created greeting/goobye messages with 
            the bot mimu and it was super fun i remember id spend hours and hours customizing the text and color and image and allat. well i 
            wouldnt consider that as coding but 
        </p>

            <h5>me at my peak making the greeting message with the mimu bot</h5>
        <p>
            also for like a few weeks in the summer of 3rd or 4rth or 5th grade i went to this summer "camp" where i learned block coding
            with that scuffed orange cat i forgot what its called like scratch or smth. 
            <br><br>
            and lastly in 2023/2024 i REALLLY wanted to just get my ass started with coding bc i really super duper really wanted to 
            make my own portfolio website. and i downloaded VS code (which im using rn) and was so strongly committed yet didnt 
            know what i was doin so ye + had ib and college apps to do sooo i just waited AND NOW IM BACK YALLLL STONRGER THAN EVERAAAA
         </p>
         </div>
         <div id="what i think about allthis">
       <h2>what i think about allthis</h2>
         <p>soo now that its summer and i have no IB stuff to worry about PLUS i need to learn how to code for my major so might asw yk.
            ive always wanted to + need it for the future so why not frrr. FIRST im not that stupid ik theres diff programming langauges 
            idk why they have a wholeass language for a snake :laugh: so since im considering UI/UX web dev was my way to go right caus
            im not interesting in AI or game dev or anything so after watching a few yt vids, figured i should go the html --> css --> java 
            route :). ദ്ദി •⩊• )
            <br><br>
            soo i started on May 20, 2025 out of boredom + sheer WILL to want to YEARN and DO SOMETHING with my summer thats not 
            bed/brain rotting hah~A!!!! ive spent like 3-6 hours everyday learning and its been pretty fun icl, ik once i start learning more
            and wanting to implement more things im gonna be on the verge of tears and crash out, but cant wait for that !!! also dont wanna 
            burn out too quickly so trying to spend less time? if that makes sense but i feel pretty motivated rn, in a different way than 
            "oh i have to study bc i want a good grade" but more like "i want to learn how to code bc i actually want to" THATS CRAZYYY
            FREE WILL AFTER IB (woooo)
         </p>
           </div>
           <div id="what ive learned so far">
       <h2>what ive learned so far</h2>
         <p>so as i mentioned before just getting started with html and learning on codecademy but idk how much free stuff they got so 
            most likely ill be jumping around diff free resources cause aint no way im paying >:D sorry yall idk how to put emojis in yet
            so gotta stick w old fashioned emoticons. 
            <br><br>
            idk why im not even answering the topic yet SO i learned html stuff and understanding
            how to read it, some basic rules like i need the / for the closers, i dont really remember the technical terms but i am aware theres
            things called elements, attributes and stuff but uhhh not that sweaty yet. learned how to create tables like the one below:
         </p>

            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th scope="col">things i dont like</th>
                    <th scope="col">why</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>truffle</td>
                    <td>the taste, i like the smell though</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>real legos</td>
                    <td>i prefer taobao legos</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>pessimistic people</td>
                    <td>too much negative energy</td>
                </tr>
            </table>

        <h5>^^except i havent learned css yet so idk how to put them in boxes LOL.</h5> 
        <p>
            I can <strong>embolden</strong> stuff and make <em>thiings</em> italicied. Ik how to make you go out of the tab like

                    <input type="range" name="rating" id="rating" value="5" min="1" max="10" step="1">
                    <span>gurt sybau</span>
                </section>
                <br><br>
                <section class="submit">
                   <input type="button" onclick="window.location.href = 'data:text/html;charset=utf-8,404';">
                   <p>dont actually submit it bc itll say file not accessed... </p>
                </section>
            </form>
            <br>
            i am so bad at formatting it so its easy to read but uhh whatever after I finish the beginner html course 
            ill get started with css bc i think ill really enjoy front-end stuff and i dont wanna see this times new roman font ahh everytime i run code. 
            i need pretty colors and fonts :( so the next step for me is to use css to make this site prettier yayyyy
